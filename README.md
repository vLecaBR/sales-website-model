<h1>sales-website-model - Portfolio Project</h1><br>
This repository contains the source code of a model sales website, developed as part of my personal portfolio. The project was built using React, JavaScript, and Styled Components, with the goal of showcasing my front-end development skills and ability to build modern user interfaces. <br>

Product Catalog: Displays a list of products with images, descriptions, and prices.
Product Detail Page: Shows detailed information about the selected product.
Shopping Cart: Allows users to add, remove, and update product quantities.
Checkout Simulation: Displays order summary and payment options.
Responsive Design: Layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing a good experience on both mobile devices and desktops. <br>


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used <br>
